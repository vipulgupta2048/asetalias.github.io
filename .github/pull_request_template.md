# Pull Request template 
_Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR_

- Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
- You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the fix/ or feature/ prefixes. Good examples are: fix/signin-issue or feature/issue-templates.
- You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).
- Your pull request MUST NOT target the master branch on this repository. You probably want to target staging instead.
- Give a descriptive title to your PR and refer the issue you are fixing.
- Provide screenshots if working on visual changes. 

**IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/asetalias/Logistics-and-Event-Contributions/wiki/Contributing-to-ALiAS) file for detailed contributing guidelines.**
